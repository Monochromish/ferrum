# Ferrum

Ferrum is a music library client.

## Dev instructions

### ToDo

- Playlist covers
- Metadata editing
- Make removing from playlists work when filter or sorting is used (rn, if you remove the first shown track, it would remove the first track in the playlist)
- Characters like Ã‰ in title is not imported right
- Write tags to files:
  - m4a/aac: https://github.com/Saecki/rust-mp4ameta
  - mp3/mp3: https://github.com/polyfloyd/rust-id3
  - audiotags
- iTunes Import overwrites library, but old track/artwork files are still kept. Either move or delete them
- Volume normalization
- For Windows version, we will want to save before system shutdown. Using `session-end` event might work, but to actually delay shutdown, see this: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8762
